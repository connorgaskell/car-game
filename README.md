## Car Game
A little car game developed in Unity, implements a Horizon Bending shader as well as a shader which creates a pixelated look and feel to the game, the map is infinitely generated. There is currently no purpose or goal to the game, I developed it as a way to learn more about how a Horizon Bending effect can be achieved.

I will likely implement more features such as a menu, obstacles and a scoring system in the near future.
